# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles.

Things you probably would need (or things I use)
  
  Mopidy (referenced in i3 configurations, change it to your media server of choice)
  
  compton (referenced in i3 configurations, change it to your compositor of choice)
  
  Font Awesome (referenced in Polybar configurations, change it to your font icon of choice)
  
  i3 (Window Manager)
  
  Polybar (bar)
  
  The colors are pulled using wpgtk
  
 The .Xres file includes the colors to be merged with .Xresources. I tend to keep it separate because it's easier to change 
 later on, using wpgtk.

The distro I use is Manjaro with XFCE desktop environment.
